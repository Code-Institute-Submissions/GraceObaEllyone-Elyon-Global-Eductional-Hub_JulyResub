BACK-END
I am building a site to sell a Coaching Services

 External user’s goal: 
 
● Learners are able to purchase  course to address their needs
Site owner's goal: 

● I will be able to earn money for provision of freelance coaching work 
Potential features to include: 

● Showcase prior work for clients, based on different kinds of course requests, and the customer's testimonials. 

● Allow users to order a particular course to suit their goals. 
The user would fill out a form describing their needs, including fields such as type (e.g. First name, Surname, Contact number, email, Next of Kin), course name, course ID and learner’s ID and course description including start date and finishing date, then Print record of achievement, get an automatic quote and then pay to PayPal Account. 
note : I will want to include a javascript calculator to display a preview of the quote, but make sure that the final price is determined on the server, and cannot be manipulated directly by the user. 


● I will be able to log in as a special user, and see a list of all courses, learners who have searched for courses available, have enrolled by filling the form and then upload their completed order which would be made available to the learner. 
Advanced potential feature (nice-to-have) 

● The learner then has the option to either accept the result, or request a round of changes. 

● Once the learner accepts the offer and complete the course, they would write a testimonial of the final success of completing the course would be automatically included in the site's showcase. 

● Build a custom js display mechanism for the Elyon Global Learning Hub Community Blog/reflective learning journal i.e learners’ experience .
